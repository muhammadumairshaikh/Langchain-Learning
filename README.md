## Tasks Completed  



# RESULTS

# Task 1: Configuration and Environment Setup

Preparing the environment so that all later tasks could run smoothly with Azure OpenAI services. The key idea was to separate sensitive information such as API keys and deployment names from the code itself, and to organize reusable logic for future tasks.

- A .env file was created to store secrets like the Azure API key, endpoint, deployment name, and API version.

- These environment variables were then loaded into the project using a config loader built inside a new components folder.

- The components folder was introduced right from the start to hold reusable functions and modules, so that later tasks (summarizer, retriever, QA chain, etc.) could all share the same clean structure.


# Task 2: Building a Basic Summarization Chain

The second task introduced the first real use of LangChain‚Äôs LLMChain, focusing on summarization. 

‚ú® Approach

- Configured an Azure OpenAI model using environment variables set up in Task 1.

- Created a prompt template instructing the model to summarize any input text into exactly 3 sentences.

- Combined the model and prompt into an LLMChain, then tested it on a ~200-word paragraph about AI.

- Modified the prompt to limit the output to 1 sentence, allowing comparison between detailed and concise summarization.

üìå Results

***3-sentence summary:***
Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulates human intelligence in machines, enabling them to learn and solve problems like humans. It encompasses various subfields, leading to advancements in technologies such as voice assistants and autonomous vehicles, while also raising ethical concerns regarding bias, job displacement, and privacy. To address these issues, stakeholders are collaborating to create guidelines for the responsible development and use of AI.

***1-sentence summary:***
Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulates human intelligence in machines, enabling them to learn and solve problems, and while it has advanced various technologies, it also raises ethical concerns that necessitate responsible development and use.

üîé Comparison

The 3-sentence version gave a richer breakdown, touching on AI‚Äôs capabilities, advancements, and ethical concerns separately.
The 1-sentence version compressed these points into a single line, which was concise but lost some clarity.


# Task 3: Exploring Retrievers with Summarization

This task combined the summarization chain from Task 2 with a document retriever. The goal was to break a long text file into chunks, embed them into a vector store, retrieve relevant pieces for a query, and then summarize them into a concise answer.

‚ú® Approach

- Created a 500-word text file (ai_intro.txt) describing the history of AI.

- Loaded the file with TextLoader, then split it into chunks of 200 characters with 20-character overlap using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

- Built an in-memory FAISS vector store with Azure OpenAI embeddings.

- Queried the retriever with the prompt ‚ÄúAI milestones‚Äù, retrieving the most relevant chunks.

- Combined the retrieved chunks and passed them into the summarization chain (set to 2 sentences).

üìå Retrieval Output

‚úÖ Total Chunks Created: 23

Top Retrieved Chunks (samples):

‚Äúcountless business applications. Each milestone in AI‚Äôs history reflects not only technological progress but also humanity‚Äôs evolving relationship with intelligent machines‚Ä¶‚Äù

This journey reflects cycles of optimism and disillusionment, highlighting both early achievements and ongoing developments in AI capabilities.**

üîé Observation

The retriever successfully narrowed down the document to the most relevant passages, and the summarizer captured both technological highlights and the cyclical nature of AI progress in just two sentences.


# Task 4: Creating an Agent for Summarization

This task introduced the concept of Agents in LangChain, which can dynamically decide which tools to use for a given query. Unlike fixed chains, an agent uses a reasoning process (thought ‚Üí action ‚Üí observation ‚Üí final answer) to pick the right tool and handle both precise and vague queries.

‚ú® Approach

- Created a TextSummarizer tool from the summarizer chain built earlier.

- Integrated it into an AgentExecutor so the agent could decide when and how to call the summarizer.

- Tested the agent with:

- A clear and specific summarization query.

- A vague request to check whether the agent can interpret it and still provide a meaningful result.

üìå Results

Test 1: Clear Request ‚Äì Impact of AI on Healthcare

Input: ‚ÄúSummarize the impact of AI on healthcare‚Äù

The agent identified the summarizer tool as needed, extracted key points, and provided:
Final Answer:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by enhancing diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes through advanced machine learning models and imaging systems. These technologies enable earlier and more accurate disease detection, optimize hospital resource management, and offer support via virtual assistants and chatbots. Despite ethical concerns regarding data privacy and bias, the integration of AI in healthcare is expanding, leading to greater efficiency and improved patient care globally.

Test 2: Vague Request ‚Äì ‚ÄúSummarize something interesting‚Äù

The agent interpreted the vague prompt, selected an example passage (discovery of penicillin), and summarized it.

Final Answer:
The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 was a pivotal moment in medical history, transforming the treatment of bacterial infections. It also laid the groundwork for the development of additional antibiotics. The profound impact of penicillin has saved countless lives and remains essential in modern medicine.

üîé Observation

Test 1 confirmed that the agent works well with clear instructions.

Test 2 showed that the agent can handle vague instructions by reasoning its way to a meaningful task (choosing a passage and summarizing it).

**This demonstrated that agents provide flexibility and robustness compared to fixed chains.**


# Task 5: Combining Chains, Retrievers, and Agents

This task extended the use of agents by combining multiple tools to complete more complex tasks. Instead of relying on just summarization, the agent was given both a TextRetriever and TextSummarizer, and later an additional WordCounter tool. The goal was to test whether the agent could chain these tools together in the right order to produce meaningful results.

‚ú® Approach

- Built tools for retrieving relevant text chunks from the document, summarizing them, and counting words.

- Integrated all tools into an AgentExecutor, giving the agent freedom to decide which tool(s) to use depending on the query.

-Tested the agent with two scenarios:

1. Retrieve + Summarize a focused topic.

2. Retrieve + Summarize + Count Words, combining reasoning with multiple tool calls.

üìå Results

**Test 1: Retrieve + Summarize**

Query: ‚ÄúAI breakthroughs‚Äù

The agent first called TextRetriever to fetch relevant document chunks.

Then, it passed the retrieved text to the TextSummarizer tool.

Final Answer:
AI systems have advanced significantly since the late 1990s, particularly with deep learning breakthroughs in the 2010s, showcasing their ability to surpass human expertise in tasks like speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing.

**Test 2: Summarize and Count Words**

Query: ‚ÄúSummarize AI breakthroughs and count the words.‚Äù

The agent again called TextRetriever, then TextSummarizer, and finally used the WordCounter tool.

Final Answer:
The summary of AI breakthroughs is:
‚ÄúAI has evolved significantly since the early 2000s, with breakthroughs in deep learning during the 2010s leading to superior performance in tasks like image recognition, highlighted by milestones such as IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.‚Äù
Word count of summary: 40

üîé Observation

- Test 1 showed that the agent could reason and use tools sequentially (retrieval ‚Üí summarization).

- Test 2 demonstrated multi-tool chaining, where the agent not only summarized but also used the WordCounter tool to calculate word length.

- This highlighted the flexibility of agents in handling composite queries and producing structured outputs.

# Task 6: Using Memory to Improve Summarization

This task focused on experimenting with LangChain memory types to observe how they affect multi-turn interactions in summarization. Two kinds of memory were tested:

ConversationBufferMemory: Stores the full conversation history verbatim.

ConversationSummaryMemory: Stores a compressed summary of the conversation so far.

The aim was to check whether memory choice impacts summarization quality and continuity when handling related queries.

‚ú® Approach

- Implemented two summarizers, one with buffer memory and one with summary memory, inside the reusable summarizer component.

- Queried both with the same sequence of topics:

- Machine Learning, Deep Learning

- Compared whether memory type changed the flow, context retention, or final summaries.

üîé Observation

- Buffer memory is more transparent, holding the raw dialogue, while summary memory becomes more useful as conversations grow longer, avoiding context overflow.

- This task demonstrated how memory influences multi-turn summarization, even though differences only emerge in extended conversations.

# Task 7: Leveraging Document Loaders for Diverse Sources

This task demonstrated how LangChain retrievers can be applied to different document sources ‚Äî a local PDF file and an online webpage. The goal was to see how the retriever‚Äìsummarizer pipeline behaves on structured academic text versus noisy web content.

üìå Results

üîπ PDF Retriever Results

Retrieved Text: Extracted coherent, domain-specific content on AI ethics.

Summary:
AI algorithms, while excelling in specific cognitive tasks traditionally performed by humans, do not introduce new ethical challenges despite their limitations in certain critical areas.

This shows that the retriever worked effectively on structured content, pulling out relevant ethical discussions.

üîπ Web Retriever Results

Retrieved Text: Instead of meaningful content, the retriever pulled in noisy material such as policies, copyright notices, and UI text from the site.

Summary:
The text outlines various policies and resources related to the Learning Lab, including user agreements, privacy, copyright, and customer support options.

This illustrates that web sources often require more aggressive cleaning and filtering, since raw HTML includes irrelevant metadata, menus, and disclaimers.

üîé Observation

- The PDF retriever clearly outperformed the web retriever in this task, producing contextually relevant summaries aligned with the query.

- The web retriever struggled because of uncleaned boilerplate content, showing the importance of data preprocessing when working with live web sources.

- Overall, retrievers can be powerful, but content quality and formatting heavily impact results.


# Task 8: Customizing with Output Parsers

This task enhanced the retriever built earlier by extending it with an extra argument to support multi-query retrieval. Instead of fetching results from just one phrasing of the query, the retriever now generates and processes multiple variations of the query, ensuring more comprehensive coverage.
- The output was formatted in JSON, combining the summary with metadata for structured results.

‚ú® Approach

- Updated the retriever in the components folder to accept an extra argument for enabling multi-query retrieval.

- Retrieved information was passed to the summarizer component.

- Final response was returned as a JSON object containing both the summary and its metadata.

üìå Results

{
  "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology impacting various industries, enhancing work, communication, and problem-solving. It offers significant benefits in healthcare, transportation, business, and education, while also raising concerns about privacy, bias, and job displacement.

- Multi-Query Retriever provided broader coverage, pulling in historical context (1950s origins) alongside modern advancements.

- This demonstrates how the extra argument for multi-query retrieval increases both breadth and depth of retrieved information.


# Task 10: Building a Question-Answering Chain on Summaries

This task explored Question Answering (QA) using two different contexts:

A summarized version of the document.

The full original document.

The goal was to observe how context size impacts the quality and depth of the QA responses.

‚ú® Approach

- Implemented a QA system that could run queries against either:

1. The summary of the document (compressed information).

2. The full document (complete knowledge base).

- Asked the question: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the key event mentioned?‚Äù

- Compared the reasoning and answers produced from both contexts.

üìå Results

üîπ QA on Summary

Answer: The Dartmouth Conference in 1956, considered the official start of AI as a field.

Rationale: Based on summarized context highlighting symbolic reasoning and problem-solving origins.

üîπ QA on Full Document

Answer: The Dartmouth Conference in 1956, regarded as the official birth of AI as a research field.

Rationale: Full context included more detail ‚Äî such as the fact that it brought together pioneering computer scientists and coined the term ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù.

üîé Observation

Both approaches identified the same key event: the Dartmouth Conference (1956).

Summary-based QA gave a concise but less detailed answer.

Full-document QA provided richer context, explaining why the event was pivotal and how it shaped AI‚Äôs origins.

**Conclusion:** Summaries make QA faster and focused, but full documents ensure completeness and richer detail.
