    Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by improving diagnosis, treatment, 
    and patient outcomes. Machine learning models are being trained on vast amounts of medical data, 
    enabling doctors to detect diseases earlier and more accurately. AI-powered imaging systems can 
    identify tumors or fractures with high precision, while predictive analytics help hospitals 
    manage patient admissions and resources more effectively. Virtual assistants and chatbots provide 
    basic medical advice and support, reducing strain on healthcare professionals. Although AI raises 
    ethical concerns about data privacy and bias, its integration into healthcare continues to grow, 
    promising improved efficiency and patient care worldwide.
